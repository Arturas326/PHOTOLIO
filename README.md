# PHOTOLIO
Practical task to create a website using a responsive design layout (I chose to use W3Schools layout).

The indexv1.php file is the main one. 
When we open the website, we see the photos, they were placed by the administrator. 
The administrator can log in using the username "admin" and the password is stored in the "slapt" file.
After logging in, with administrator rights, the administrator can add a photo with a name and a short description, or delete photos. 
When adding a photo and giving it a name and description, the data is stored in the XAMPP database, in this work the database username is "root" and the password is absent. 
However, the website does not upload data from there. 
In this work, a db.txt file is also created, in which, after uploading a photo, the photo name, description and path where the photos are stored appear, and the photos are displayed from the db.txt file. 
A copy of the photo is also saved in the "photo" folder.

This work was created by using PHP, XAMPP, SQL, JavaScrypt
